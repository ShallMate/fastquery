# Fast Infringement Localization for Data Ownership Confirmation

## Project Overview

This repository provides an implementation of the **Fast Infringement Localization** (FIL) algorithm, developed by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, as part of a data ownership confirmation system. The **FIL** algorithm aims to enhance the performance of data ownership verification, specifically for fast and accurate infringement localization.

Please note that this repository contains only a partial implementation related to the **image modality** and is not a full implementation of the system.

**Fast Infringement Localization** is a pluggable component within the data ownership confirmation system, designed to improve the performance of data ownership verification.
